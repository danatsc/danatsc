- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dana Tschirch
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code with Python
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python but I am only a beginner who's been working with Python intermittently. I am not doing this for a job in programming. I am retired
     for some time now and I have found it to be a nice way to spend some of my free time.
